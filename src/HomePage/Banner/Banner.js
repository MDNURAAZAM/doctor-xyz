            As a surgeon, I will perform operations by cutting open a patient's
            body to repair, remove or replace the diseased or damaged part. As
            well as operating, I will carry out ward rounds and outpatients
            clinics and will take on a range of administrative duties and
            teaching responsibilities. Becoming a surgeon can take many years
            and there needs a high level of commitment to succeed. Competition
            for places can be fierce, particularly in the later stages of
            training. New surgery techniques are continually evolving so I will
            learn new skills throughout my career and try to improve my skills.
